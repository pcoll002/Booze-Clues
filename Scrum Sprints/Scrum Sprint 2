Scrum Sprint Goals 10/10 - 10/24

Our discussions with our customer have gone in many different directions over the course of this project, specifically the
last two or three weeks, but we finally have a compromise that satisfies both parties. We redesigned the interface, removing
the searchbar and are going to implement interactive boxes that show a picture of the bar and when clicked upon will bring you
to the bars page. We beleive that going in this direction of working interactive components into our application, we will be able 
to appeal to customer's idea of how the application should work. We also hope to include a back to the top of the page button 
that follows you as you scroll.
