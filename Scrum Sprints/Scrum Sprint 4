Scrum Sprint 11/8 - 11/21

Goals:
 To set up each bar's/ restarunats page when clicking the widget. Each page will have:
        a description of the bar 
        the address accompanied with a google maps screen shot 
        a calender of special events
        drink specials if it's a bar
        menu's if it's a restarant 
        

 Translate the code to French for the working demo on 11/14
        
 We also plan to start our database to store the user logins. As of right now when you sign in with your information it isn't saved and 
 you have to re- signup everytime you try to login. You will be able to create an account with a unique username and password that will allow you access to the app. The username and 
 password will be stored in the database. We want to implement a way to keep other users from having the same sign in as someone else too.
 If time permits hopefully we will find a way to make the sign-in/up proess easier and be able to connect the account with that user's 
 Facebook.
