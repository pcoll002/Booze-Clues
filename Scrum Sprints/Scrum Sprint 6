Scrum Sprint 6
December 5th -- December 16th

Goals:

  We decided to completely ditch the Visual Basic aspect of the project and turn in a new direction. We are now coding the entire project
    in HTML. As stated in the previous scrum statement, this allows for all members of the team to contribute some coding. It also proved 
    to be much more versital with designing aspects. Due to the time constraint of this late switch we have a lot to accomplish over the
    course of a few short days so accomlishing more than we already have designed may be a bit of a stretch.
    
  We are also still trying to make this an app. We are experimenting with different app makers trying to make an accompaning app with the 
    webpage.
