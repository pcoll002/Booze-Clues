Status Report 11-9

We continue to work on the French translation for the presentation on 11-14. We began to compile a list of drink specials for each bar 
so we can create a drink special section under each bar's page. We continue to work on the rest of the item's on the description page 
as mentioned in previous status reports. We continue to try and create an effective database so the login process runs more smoothly.
