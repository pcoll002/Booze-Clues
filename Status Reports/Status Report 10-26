Our team has adjusted to the new interface layout design that was proposed earlier last week. We implemented the widget-like interface
and can now show a preview of each bar or restaurant with a picture as well as a breif description. There will be more content provided
for the application during the current scrum sprint. The team will be focusing mainly on the log in and sign up features that is not yet 
finished, but as far as the interface goes we are on our way to providing the useful widget feature.
