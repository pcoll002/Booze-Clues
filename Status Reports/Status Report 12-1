The Booze-Clues team has been gearing up to finish off this project. We have increased the number of hours we have been meeting,
and everything seems to be coming together. We are finishing up each bars individual page, and working on getting an event page
up and running. Pat is in the process of researching a mobile aspect of our project. Mason is in the process of adding slideshows
of pictures of the bars on their respective page.


**** Status Update ****
I am working on utilizing adobe PhoneGap to show our HTML and CSS pages in application form. I have been troubleshooting getting the
mobile application connected to the desktop application and have been recieving some difficulty connecting the two. I will continue to 
troubleshoot and research how to fix this problem throughout the coming week.
