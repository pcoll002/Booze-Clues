Status Report 12-1-16

The Booze-Clues team has been gearing up to finish off this project. We have increased the number of hours we have been meeting,
and everything seems to be coming together. We are finishing up each bars individual page, and working on getting an event page
up and running. Pat is in the process of researching a mobile aspect of our project. Mason is in the process of adding slideshows
of pictures of the bars on their respective page.
