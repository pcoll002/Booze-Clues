After the lastest meeting with Quantum, he suggested to redesign the interface to make it more user friendly and attractive to customers. 
Instead of working with a searchbar and drop-down menus, we will make each bar its own wigdets. Each widget will have a picture of the 
bar or it's logo. When clicked upon the widget will bring you to the bars page which will display the bars information. We also are
planning to implment a back to the top search when scrolling. It may set us back temporarily but the end result will pay dividends.
