We put most of the developmental aspects of our application on hold when we found out we had to translate the body of our work into French.
With Booze Clues it shouldn't be to difficult to translate everthing considering most of our app is just text. We will continue to work on
the interface of each individual bar adding the addres with a pic of the bar itself from google maps, drink speicals and events and menu's 
if the bar serves food.
