Status Report 12-12 

  We are coming to the final days of the project and wrapping everything up. We have succesfully created a functional webpage using HTML.
  It displays all the information we hoped for given our limited time frame. Unfortunately we were uncusccessful in creating an accompaning 
  phone app. We tried several options over both OSX and Windows but came up epmty handed. For the final days of the project, we plan on
  improving the functionality of the webpage, cleaning up the design and adding any other cool things that could benefit the webapge.
