I have been testing different ways to figure out how to connect the mobile Phone Gap application with the Desktop Application server
and finally with some research I realized the problem that I was running into stemmed from my phone security preferences. After altering
the preferences I was able to connect to the desktop app. and then proceded to build the application on the desktop to then be shown on
the mobile application. After successfully linking the Booze Clues github repository to the PhoneGap application build page I did run 
into a problem with the configure file. I am still working on fixing this problem because I found the configure file in the PhoneGap
github repository and I am not too sure what needs to be changed. To my knowledge once I figure out the problem with the configure file
the application should be up and running on the mobile device.
