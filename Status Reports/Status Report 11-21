Our group has met and brainstormed different ways to present the drink deals information on the application. We decided that if we 
code the bar deals using HTML it could be a better way to try and present the information rather than just using visual basic. 
It is also a good way of getting our whole team involved with the coding. We will prresent the bar deals information using HTML 
for more of a webpage feel, as well as to make it easier to jump around from bar to bar and see the individual deals. Along side of 
doing this we will continue to work on the database for our login and try to have that resolved soon.
