# Booze-Clues
Software Engineering Project 

Booze Clues is a mobile application that will create a more centralized app for Plattsburghs downtown bar scene. Our focus group is 
aimed mostly towards college students, but will be available to anyone in the Plattsburgh area. We are drawing ideas from applications 
that already exist but presenting the information in a simpler way.
